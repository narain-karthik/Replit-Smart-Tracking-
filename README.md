## üîß Installation

### Local Installation (Windows/Mac/Linux)

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Running on Replit

The application is pre-configured to run on Replit:

1. The Flask API server starts automatically on port 5000
2. Access the API through the web preview
3. The desktop GUI (main.py) requires a graphical display and won't run in the web environment

## üìñ How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Register Your Device**
   - Run `python main.py` to launch the GUI application
   - Fill in your information:
     - Owner Name
     - Email
     - Password (minimum 6 characters)
     - Contact Number
   - Click "Register Device"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Save the API Key shown - you'll need it for remote access!

2. **Login**
   - After registration, login with your email and password
   - You'll see the main control panel with multiple tabs

### Using the Desktop Application (GUI)

The control panel has several tabs:

#### üìä Status Tab
- View device information
- Check registration status
- See system details (CPU, memory, disk)

#### üîí Lock Tab
- Lock your device locally
- Set a custom message for anyone who finds it
- Unlock with your credentials

#### üìç Location Tab
- Get current location (IP-based)
- View Wi-Fi networks nearby
- See location history

#### üì∏ Evidence Tab
- Capture webcam photos
- Take screenshots
- View captured evidence files
- Capture evidence sets (multiple photos + screenshots)

#### üö® Alarm Tab
- Test alarm (3 seconds)
- Trigger theft alarm (30 seconds)
- Stop alarm manually

#### üìù Logs Tab
- View all security events
- Export evidence report for law enforcement
- Track all activities with timestamps

### Using the Remote API

The Flask API server allows you to control your device remotely.

#### Starting the API Server

```bash
python remote_server.py
```

The server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` (or your Replit URL)

#### API Endpoints

All API requests require authentication using your API key in the header:
```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

**Available Endpoints:**

1. **Get Device Status**
   ```bash
   GET /api/status
   ```

2. **Lock Device Remotely**
   ```bash
   POST /api/lock
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "message": "Custom lock message (optional)"
   }
   ```

3. **Unlock Device**
   ```bash
   POST /api/unlock
   ```

4. **Get Location**
   ```bash
   GET /api/location
   ```

5. **Trigger Alarm**
   ```bash
   POST /api/alarm
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "duration": 30
   }
   ```

6. **Capture Evidence**
   ```bash
   POST /api/capture
   ```

7. **Get Event Logs**
   ```bash
   GET /api/logs?count=20
   ```

8. **Get Device Info**
   ```bash
   GET /api/device-info
   ```

#### Example API Usage (Python)

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
BASE_URL = "http://your-replit-url.repl.co"

headers = {
    "X-API-Key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Lock the device
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/lock",
    headers=headers,
    json={"message": "This laptop is stolen! Contact owner for reward!"}
)
print(response.json())

# Get location
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/location", headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

See `remote_client_example.py` for a complete Python client implementation.

## üîê Security Features

- **AES-256 Encryption** - All sensitive data is encrypted
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** - Secure password-based encryption (100,000 iterations)
- **No Plaintext Keys** - Encryption keys never stored on disk
- **API Key Authentication** - Secure 32-byte URL-safe tokens for remote access
- **Failed Login Tracking** - Logs all unauthorized access attempts
- **Salt-based Encryption** - Unique device salt for enhanced security

## üìÅ Data Storage

All sensitive data is stored in the `data/` directory:
- `data/auth.enc` - Encrypted user credentials
- `data/api_auth.enc` - Encrypted API credentials
- `data/device_info.json` - Device identification
- `data/evidence/` - Captured photos and screenshots
- `data/logs/` - Event logs
- `data/.server_secret` - Flask session secret

**Important**: Never share these files or commit them to version control!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Keep Your API Key Safe** - Anyone with your API key can control your device
2. **Remember Your Password** - Password recovery is not available (by design for security)
3. **GUI Requires Display** - The desktop application needs a graphical environment
4. **Audio May Be Limited** - Headless environments may not support alarm functionality
5. **Location Accuracy** - IP-based location is approximate; not GPS-accurate

## üöÄ Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Replit using Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --workers=2 remote_server:app
```

Click the "Deploy" button in Replit to publish your API server to production.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto'"
Install dependencies: `pip install pycryptodome`

### "No audio device available"
Normal in headless environments. Alarm functionality will be disabled but all other features work.

### "Device not registered"
Run `python main.py` first to register your device through the GUI.

### API returns "Unauthorized"
Check that you're using the correct API key in the `X-API-Key` header.
