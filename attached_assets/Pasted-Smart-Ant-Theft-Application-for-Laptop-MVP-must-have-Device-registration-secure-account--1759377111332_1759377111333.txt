Smart Ant-Theft Application for Laptop 

MVP (must-have)

Device registration & secure account — user signs up; device links to account with device ID and strong keys.

Remote lock / show message — lock screen remotely and display owner contact / reward message.

Location tracking — approximate geolocation via IP + Wi-Fi SSID triangulation (no GPS required).

Theft evidence capture — capture webcam photo(s) and system screenshot(s) when suspicious event triggers.

Tamper-resistance / service mode — agent runs as a system service/daemon and restarts automatically; uninstall requires credentials.

Alarm / loud siren — trigger loud sound even if volume is low.

Event logging & export — record timestamps, IPs, nearby Wi-Fi SSIDs, photos; exportable as evidence for police.

Secondary (near-term)
8. Proximity locking — lock/unlock when paired smartphone (Bluetooth LE) moves away/returns.
9. Automatic trigger detection — detect suspicious events: repeated wrong password attempts, boot from external media, account change.
10. Geo-fencing — alerts when device leaves/enters defined area.
11. Remote wipe / selective wipe — erase sensitive folders or securely wipe disk (opt-in, with warnings).
12. Network blocker — disable network adapters or firewall rules to stop remote access (careful UX).
13. Snapshot of active sessions / running processes — helps forensic context.

Advanced / Nice-to-have
14. SIM/LTE support & SIM-change alerts — for laptops with cellular modems.
15. Offline caching / delayed upload — store evidence locally and auto-upload when online.
16. Hardware tamper detection — trigger alerts if case opened (where sensors available).
17. Integration with law enforcement export flow — packaged report with evidence and timeline.
18. Peer beaconing — crowd-sourced discovery: other app users can help detect nearby stolen device beacons (privacy-first).
19. Anti-snoop features — remote screenshot on suspect user, clipboard monitoring (very sensitive — see legal).
20. Enterprise mode — remote management/dashboard for organizations.
